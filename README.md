### Hi, I'm Kaylin!

I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in Statistics and Machine Learning, with an additional major in Technical Writing. Some things I'm working on:

- Revamping my website portfolio! It's still going through a lot of work, but you can view it here: <a href="https://kaylinli.github.io/">https://kaylinli.github.io/</a>
- Coordinating social impact data projects for Students Using Data Science at CMU! Check out our work here: <a href="https://suds-cmu.org/">https://suds-cmu.org/</a>
- Writing, editing and designing layout for the CMU newspaper, The Tartan! Check out some of the articles I've written at https://thetartan.org/staff/kaylinl.

Past projects:
- Building a website for Sentence Mosaics, a speech-language therapy app. Check it out at <a href="https://sentencemosaics.com/">https://sentencemosaics.com/</a>
