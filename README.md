### Hi, I'm Kaylin!

I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University, planning on majoring Statistics and Machine Learning. Some things I'm working on:

- Updating my website portfolio! Check it out at <a href="https://kaylinli.me">https://kaylinli.me</a>
- Building a website for Sentence Mosaics, a speech-language therapy app. Check it out at <a href="https://sentencemosaics.com/">https://sentencemosaics.com/</a>
- Writing for the CMU newspaper! Check out some of the articles I've written at https://thetartan.org/staff/kaylinl.
